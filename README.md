## Continuous Integration (CI) Tutorials

### Why Continuous Integration (CI)
- While working on the project, changes are bound to happen, so dont you think there must be a testing protocol or service which checks if the coding standards are followed, there are no bugs, it gives a proper output or not? This is where Continuous Integration (CI) comes into play.


### What is Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository. Each integration is automatically verified by building the application and running tests to detect errors as early as possible.

### Tools For Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Github Actions**
- **Jenkins**
- **Travis CI**


### What is Github Actions
- An automated service which is smart enough to detect the changes in the codebase, automatically run tests, and provide feedback to the developers is Github Actions.
- This checks can be given in the form of a YAML File. The Github actions executes the defined workflows from the YAML file.
